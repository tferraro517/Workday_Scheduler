Third party API Workday Scheduler

As an employee with a need to manage my time
I WANT to log events in a daily planner
SO THAT I can stay organized

I am givent a daily planner
WHEN I click on and open the planner
THEN it will show the current date
WHEN I view the entire page
THEN I will see color coordiated time blocks for a typical work day
WHEN I look at each block of time
THEN they will be assinged a color for either past, present or future
WHEN I select a time black
THEN I will be able to log an event or note
WHEN I select the save button for that timeblock
THEN the the information I logged will be saved
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the events will stay in place
